_This is a new tool. The code is a mess and it's very buggy. PRs are very welcome!_

# Getting started

The extension isn't available on the Google Chrome Webstore for now.

## 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/baptisteArno/puppeteer-ui-extension.git
```

## 2. Install and build the extension

Using `yarn`:

```sh
cd puppeteer-ui-extension
yarn
yarn build
```

Or using `npm`:

```sh
npm i
npm run build
```

## 3. Integrate into Google Chrome (or any Chromium browser)

Navigate to:

```text
chrome://extensions/
```

Check the "Developer Mode" and click on "Load an unpacked extension" and select the `build` folder of the project.

Now you should see the extension and you can start scrapping websites.

_For now, you can only generates a puppeteer script written in Typescript. But I'm planning on making it friendlier_
